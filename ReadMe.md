# OpenVINS Vehicle Updates

This is the official implementation of the paper "Visual-Inertial Odometry aided by Speed and Steering Angle Measurements". It enables OpenVINS to use speed and steering angle measurements for ground vehicles. Take a look at our [launch file](https://github.com/aserbremen/open_vins/blob/master/ov_msckf/launch/serial_vehicle_updates.launch) on how to use it. Further information coming soon.
